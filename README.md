# Java Generics 2 A Assignment

## Objective:
To enhance your understanding of Java Generics by implementing and utilizing more complex generic structures.

## Project Structure:
- **Cache.java**: A generic cache implementation.
- **Pair.java**: A multi-type generic Pair class.
- **Stack.java**: A generic stack implementation.
- **Utility.java**: Contains generic utility methods such as sorting and handling wildcards.
- **Main.java**: The entry point demonstrating the functionality of all classes.

## Features:
1. **Multi-Type Generic Pair**: Implements a generic class `Pair` that holds a key-value pair.
2. **Generic Stack**: A generic `Stack` class that handles push, pop, and underflow exceptions.
3. **Generic Sort Utility**: A static method to sort a list of comparable elements.
4. **Wildcard Usage**: Methods for printing collections and summing numbers using wildcards.
5. **Generic Cache**: A `Cache` class with functionality to add, retrieve, and clear cache entries, including a method to add all items from one cache to another.

## Running the Program:
1. Compile all the Java files.
2. Run the `Main` class to see the demonstration of generics in action.
